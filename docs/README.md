Mona's goal is to define a generic high level framework, that applies to most of the use cases, and then go deeper with specialized sub-frameworks for each specific use case.

This goal tries to be achieved by abstracting the software architecture and the lifecycle workflow as much as possible, independently from current solutions.

The vision is to achieve a level of abstraction that allows to conceptually define the app functionality and automatically get the app created, the source code, UIs, APIs, documentation and deployment to any platform like Desktop and Mobile Web, iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.

Mona Framework is composed by the following areas:

* Architecture
* Components
* [Workflow](/mona/workflow.md)
* Tools
* Best Practices

In a first phase, Mona will takcle the following use case:

* iOS and Android app with local data
